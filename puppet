Puppet is like an configuration tool

launch 3 ubuntu instances.one is client and 2 is agent

it's an pull based machanism

Puppet Master Installation:
wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppet6-release-bionic.deb
sudo dpkg -i puppet6-release-bionic.deb
apt update
apt-get install puppetserver -y

Note:
before u run puppetserver we need to configure puppet
default it will be on
ls /opt/puppetlabs/server/bin/
cp /opt/puppetlabs/server/bin/ /usr/local/bin/
cp /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/puppet /usr/local/bin/

now u run the setup it will configure now

puppetserver ca setup
service puppetserver start

vi /etc/hostname

privateip puppet puppet.local
privateip2 client1 client1.local
privateip3 client2 client2.local

and


login into agents server
nano /etc/hostnames (note for master give name as puppet)
gives that name and reboot it.

**** after login into the agents
Puppet Agent Installation:
wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppet6-release-bionic.deb
sudo dpkg -i puppet6-release-bionic.deb
apt update
apt-get install puppet-agent -y


cp /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/puppet /usr/local/bin/

type
puppet agent --test
it fails we need to configure hosts

vi /etc/hosts(remove the previous data)

below are hostnames of cilent)
privateip puppet puppet.local
privateip2 client1 client1.local
privateip3 client2 client2.local


now type 

puppet agent --test

after go to the client type

ppetserver ca list -all

puppetserver ca sign --certname certificatename


do the same things for client 2 also


in ansible we called as playbooks here we called as manifest 

in client

cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests
vi main.pp

node default {

notify {'this is default config':}

}

now go to agent type


puppet agent -t 

note: all configuration we will maintain in ("client") /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests
